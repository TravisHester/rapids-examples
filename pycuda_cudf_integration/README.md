# Using PyCuda and Cudf
## Overview
Sometimes, a user may wish to conduct custom numeric operations on a `cudf` column. However, to do this through custom cython bindings may require significant work and overhead, as shown [here](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-examples/tree/main/shareable-dataframes). A quick, but more limiting alternative would be to make use of `PyCuda`, allowing us to write simple CUDA kernels that are able to modify our `cudf` dataframe.
